## Calendars / dating systems

### ACDH-CH Linked Open Date Entities (LODE)

ACDH-CH Linked Open Date Entities (LODE) is a data service to provide information about (historical) dates, using Linked Open Data (LOD) techniques. Currently, the entities provide lookups for the time concepts for the precision of day, month, year, decade, century, and millennium. For practical reasons, the 1st implementation covers 6000 years between 3000 BC/BCE and AD/CE 3000 based on ISO8601.

### Geologic Time Scale (2020)

RDF representation of the Geologic Time Scale, as defined in the International Chronostratigraphic Chart (ICC) from the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS). The ICC embraces both chronostratigraphic (time-rock) units and their equivalent geochronologic (geologic-time) units, the former being related to the ‘Stratigraphic points’ referred to below, and the latter (geochronologic units) being employed in this RDF representation.

### Graph of Dated Objects and Texts (GODOT)

The aim of this graph database system is to create and maintain a gazetteer of calendar dates in different calendar systems, initially those used in Greek and Roman antiquity across the mediterranean area, and provide links to attestations of these dates in online editions. Like geographical gazetteers this authority list can be used to provide stable, unique identifiers (URIs) for each date in any of the calendar systems that has been used to refer to an astronomical day in any ancient source, whether literary texts, papyri, ostraca or inscriptions. It will serve as a means to search and browse ancient texts by their precise temporal footprint using these URIs in digital editions and databases or TEI/EpiDoc XML driven projects. Currently there are some 5,800 dates in the database, based on more than 7,000 attestations, from a number of different ancient calendar and dating systems.

### Trismegistos Time

A database of chronological aspects of texts from the ancient world. TM Time is still in its initial phase. Right now it should be seen as a tool to convert dates from old calendar systems to new and vice-versa, which also facilitates finding texts dated to specific periods in Trismegistos.

## Modeling / visualization tools

### Aeon Timeline

Present historical events along an interactive visual timeline. Record precise times or use broad, uncertain dates. Map events to historical figures or important theories and movements. See individual timelines for specific people and concepts.

* [Aeon Timeline](https://timeline.app)

### ChronoLog Chronological Toolkit

ChronoLog is a software tool for chronological research in archaeology. It allows users to build complex models featuring chronological sequences, bounds on dates and durations, and various types of synchronisms. The software automatically checks the validity of such models, and computes the tightest possible chronological ranges for the date and duration of each chronological object in the  model.

* [ChronoLog](https://chrono.ulb.be)

### ChronoVis: Paintbox

A no-code graphical interface for generating temporal data visualizations, designed by the humanities for the humanities.

* [Chronovis: Paintbox](https://huegor.github.io/chronovis-paintbox/)

### HuTime Time Information System Software

HuTime is a time information system software application that can help users visualize and analyze temporal information based on time data. Researchers can create chronological tables and charts that include events over various time spans, from periods as short as a single day or hour, to periods as long as a year or century. Thus, users can examine the loaded data in its entirety using the expanded displayed temporal range, and gain an understanding of the times when event information is concentrated or when drastic changes occur. From that point, the user can shrink the displayed temporal range to investigate the details of various events in the most relevant periods.

### Matrix

The Matrix investigates how digital data from archaeological excavations can be more consistently recorded, analysed, disseminated and archived in a way that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-useable (FAIR). In particular, the work addresses the lack of standardised approaches to the digital archiving and reuse of archaeological data stratigraphic and phasing data.

The Matrix project has developed software to support stratigraphic analysis and temporal analysis - Phasing, Grouping and Periodization - by archaeologists using Harris Matrix methodologies. The prototype software tool is called "Phaser". The Prototype _is not intended currently to be fully functioning_ Matrix recording and Stratigraphic Phasing analysis and archiving software. It would need more development and administrative work and resources to make it available e.g. as Open and FAIR software through an online tool with suitable registration for an archaeological community of users.

## Periods

### iDAI ChronOntology

iDAI.chronontology (short form: ChronOntology) is a web service that connects chronological terms, i.e. epochs, periods and events, with dating information. Hosted by the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) and part of the iDAI.welt, ChronOntology is an internet research tool for the Archaeology and Altertumswissenschaft (ancient studies and literature). Anyone can refer to its data, and anyone can add their additional project-specific or research-specific data on request. At the DAI, ChronOntology is the standard gazetteer for period names. Like the iDAI.gazetteer for place names, it serves as a norm data vocabulary for other information systems at the DAI and links them with other global time gazetteer systems.

### PeriodO

PeriodO is a public domain gazetteer of scholarly definitions of historical, art-historical, and archaeological periods. It eases the task of linking among datasets that define periods differently. It also helps scholars and students see where period definitions overlap or diverge.

## Standards

### CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model

The CIDOC CRM is a formal ontology intended to facilitate the integration, mediation and interchange of heterogeneous cultural heritage information and similar information from other domains. It includes a set of properties relating to temporal entities supporting the documentation of dates as time-spans or dimensions, mereological relations between temporal entities, as well as a complete suite of topological relations.

* [Definition of the CIDOC CRM (version 7.2.2, September 2022)](https://www.cidoc-crm.org/sites/default/files/cidoc_crm_version_7.2.2%5B20%20Oct%5D.pdf)

### Extended Date/Time Format (EDTF)

The Extended Date and Time Format (EDTF) was developed at the Library of Congress and is now incorporated into the ISO 8601 standard for representing dates and times. EDTF specifies a standard syntax for expressing uncertain or approximate Gregorian calendar dates, dates with missing parts, sets of possible dates, and open-ended or recurring intervals of time.

* [EDTF Ontology](https://periodo.github.io/edtf-ontology/)

### Linked Places Format

The Linked Places format supercedes the Pelagios Gazetteer Interconnection Format (PGIF) as a standard for contributions to several partner projects in the Pelagios Network including Recogito, Peripleo-lite, the World Historical Gazetteer, and PeriodO. It is an implementation of GeoJSON-T, an experimental extension to GeoJSON that standardizes the representation of temporal attributes, and it provides for optional temporal scoping of names, geometry, place types, and place relations.

* [Linked Places Format](https://github.com/LinkedPasts/linked-places-format)

### Time Ontology in OWL

OWL-Time is an OWL-2 DL ontology of temporal concepts, for describing the temporal properties of resources in the world or described in Web pages. The ontology provides a vocabulary for expressing facts about topological (ordering) relations among instants and intervals, together with information about durations, and about temporal position including date-time information. Time positions and durations may be expressed using either the conventional (Gregorian) calendar and clock, or using another temporal reference system such as Unix-time, geologic time, or different calendars.

### Vocabularies Consortium Chronology Working Group

The documentation available from the Chronology Working Group of the Vocabularies Consortium is intended as a set of minimum best practice guidelines for structuring and linking metadata collections pertaining to chronological knowledge in cuneiform studies. Documentation provided below for individual data entities offers guidance on the alignment and linking of relevant metadata records to external reference indices in order to improve data interoperability, discoverability, and reuse.

### Wikidata Dates

Wikidata offers a series of properties with datatype time, which allow storage of basic information defining single point in time. Time datatype can be further expanded with custom qualifiers to allow great range of possible time expressions. Adding and querying dates may seem simple, but available precision and changing calendars add complexity.
